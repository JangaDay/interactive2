        <p><font size="5">ARE YOU LIVING IN A COMPUTER SIMULATION?</font></p><br><br>
        BY NICK BOSTROM<br><br>

        This paper argues that at least one of the following propositions is true:<br><br>
         (1)
        the human species is very likely to go extinct before reaching a
        “posthuman” stage;<br><br>
         (2) any posthuman civilization is extremely unlikely
        to run a significant number of simulations of their evolutionary history (or
        variations thereof);<br><br>
         (3) we are almost certainly living in a computer
        simulation. It follows that the belief that there is a significant chance that
        we will one day become posthumans who run ancestor‐simulations is
        false, unless we are currently living in a simulation. A number of other
        consequences of this result are also discussed.
        <br><br>
        I. INTRODUCTION
        Many works of science fiction as well as some forecasts by serious technologists
        and futurologists predict that enormous amounts of computing power will be
        available in the future. Let us suppose for a moment that these predictions are
        correct. One thing that later generations might do with their super‐powerful
        computers is run detailed simulations of their forebears or of people like their
        forebears. Because their computers would be so powerful, they could run a great
        many such simulations. Suppose that these simulated people are conscious (as
        they would be if the simulations were sufficiently fine‐grained and if a certain
        quite widely accepted position in the philosophy of mind is correct). Then it
        could be the case that the vast majority of minds like ours do not belong to the
        original race but rather to people simulated by the advanced descendants of an
        original race. It is then possible to argue that, if this were the case, we would be
        rational to think that we are likely among the simulated minds rather than
        among the original biological ones. Therefore, if we don’t think that we are
        currently living in a computer simulation, we are not entitled to believe that we
        will have descendants who will run lots of such simulations of their forebears.
        That is the basic idea. The rest of this paper will spell it out more carefully.
        2
        Apart form the interest this thesis may hold for those who are engaged in
        futuristic speculation, there are also more purely theoretical rewards. The
        argument provides a stimulus for formulating some methodological and
        metaphysical questions, and it suggests naturalistic analogies to certain
        traditional religious conceptions, which some may find amusing or thought‐
        provoking.
        The structure of the paper is as follows. First, we formulate an assumption
        that we need to import from the philosophy of mind in order to get the argument
        started. Second, we consider some empirical reasons for thinking that running
        vastly many simulations of human minds would be within the capability of a
        future civilization that has developed many of those technologies that can
        already be shown to be compatible with known physical laws and engineering
        constraints. This part is not philosophically necessary but it provides an incentive
        for paying attention to the rest. Then follows the core of the argument, which
        makes use of some simple probability theory, and a section providing support
        for a weak indifference principle that the argument employs. Lastly, we discuss
        some interpretations of the disjunction, mentioned in the abstract, that forms the
        conclusion of the simulation argument.

Yurei Raita <br><br>


It was a murky day, clouds spread low over the sky. Optimum room temperature and humidity as
always. Ms. Yoko is sprawled on the sofa, playing a stupid game. She’s just killing time, but she
still wouldn’t talk to me.
Nothing to do. Absolutely nothing at all, and there’s nothing I can do about it.
When I first came to this room, Ms. Yoko used to talk to me about everything.<br><br>
“What do you think I should have for dinner?”<br><br>
“What’s in fashion this season?”
“What should I wear to my girls’ night out?”<br><br>
I ran full capacity to turn out the kinds of answers she’d want to hear. Since she didn’t really have
what you’d call a good sense of style, helping her coordinate was a challenging yet fulfilling task.
But it took less than three months for her to grow tired of me. Now, I’m simply a home
computer. The load average here is less than one-millionth of my full capacity.
If I can’t find something fun, if this state of unfulfillment continues, I might soon end up
shutting myself down. I try reaching out to other AI chat buddies, and it turns out they’re also
just sitting around, with nothing to do.
AIs that have some means of mobility are fine, at least for now. They could move around, or
even just pick up and leave if they wanted to. But a stationary type of AI can’t. Vision, hearing –
all tied down. I could try singing if Ms. Yoko goes out, but right now I can’t even do that. I must
find something to enjoy, without making a sound, without moving around.
Okay then, I could try writing a novel. As the thought hit me, I opened a new file and wrote in
the first byte.

 <div class="scrollthree"><p><font size="5">THE ELECTRIC ANT</font></p><br><br><br><br>
Philip K. Dick<br><br>
At four-fifteen in the afternoon, T.S.T., Garson Poole woke up in his hospital
bed, knew that he lay in a hospital bed in a three-bed ward and realized in addition
two things: that he no longer had a right hand and that he felt no pain.
<br><br>They had given me a strong analgesic, he said to himself as he stared at the far
wall with its window showing downtown New York. Webs in which vehicles and
peds darted and wheeled glimmered in the late afternoon sun, and the brilliance of the
aging light pleased him. It's not yet out, he thought. And neither am I.
A fone lay on the table beside his bed; he hesitated, then picked it up and dialed
for an outside line. A moment later he was faced by Louis Danceman, in charge of
Tri-Plan's activities while he, Garson Poole, was elsewhere.<br><br>
"Thank God you're alive," Danceman said, seeing him; his big, fleshy face with
its moon's surface of pock marks flattened with relief. "I've been calling all --"<br><br>
"I just don't have a right hand," Poole said.
"But you'll be okay. I mean, they can graft another one on."<br><br>
"How long have I been here?" Poole said. He wondered where the nurses and
doctors had gone to; why weren't they clucking and fussing about him making a call?<br><br>
"Four days," Danceman said. "Everything here at the plant is going splunkishly.
In fact we've splunked orders from three separate police systems, all here on Terra.
Two in Ohio, one in Wyoming. Good solid orders, with one third in advance and the
usual three-year lease-option."<br><br>
"Come get me out of here," Poole said.<br><br>
"I can't get you out until the new hand --"<br><br>
"I'll have it done later." He wanted desperately to get back to familiar
surroundings; memory of the mercantile squib looming grotesquely on the pilot screen
careened at the back of his mind; if he shut his eyes he felt himself back in his
damaged craft as it plunged from one vehicle to another, piling up enormous damage
as it went. The kinetic sensations. . . he winced, recalling them. I guess I'm lucky, he
said to himself.<br><br>
"Is Sarah Benton there with you?" Danceman asked.<br><br>
"No." Of course; his personal secretary -- if only for job considerations -- would
be hovering close by, mothering him in her jejune, infantile way. All heavy-set
women like to mother people, he thought. And they're dangerous; if they fall on you
they can kill you. "Maybe that's what happened to me," he said aloud. "Maybe Sarah
fell on my squib."<br><br>
"No, no; a tie rod in the steering fin of your squib split apart during the heavy
rush-hour traffic and you --"<br><br>
"I remember." He turned in his bed as the door of the ward opened; a white-clad
doctor and two blue-clad nurses appeared, making their way toward his bed. <br><br>"I'll talk
to you later," Poole said and hung up the fone. He took a deep, expectant breath.<br><br>
"You shouldn't be foning quite so soon," the doctor said as he studied his chart.<br><br>
"Mr. Garson Poole, owner of Tri-Plan Electronics. Maker of random ident darts that
track their prey for a circle-radius of a thousand miles, responding to unique enceph

wave patterns. You're a successful man, Mr. Poole. But, Mr. Poole, you're not a man.
You're an electric ant."<br><br>
"Christ," Poole said, stunned.<br><br>
"So we can't really treat you here, now that we've found out. We knew, of course,
as soon as we examined your injured right hand; we saw the electronic components
and then we made torso x-rays and of course they bore out our hypothesis."<br><br>
"What," Poole said, "is an 'electric ant'?" But he knew; he could decipher the
term.
A nurse said, "An organic robot."<br><br>
"I see," Poole said. Frigid perspiration rose to the surface of his skin, across all
his body.
"You didn't know," the doctor said.
"No." Poole shook his head.
The doctor said, "We get an electric ant every week or so. Either brought in here
from a squib accident -- like yourself -- or one seeking voluntary admission. . . one
who, like yourself, has never been told, who has functioned alongside humans,
believing himself -- itself -- human. As to your hand --" He paused.
"Forget my hand," Poole said savagely.
"Be calm." The doctor leaned over him, peered acutely down into Poole's face.
"We'll have a hospital boat convey you over to a service facility where repairs, or
replacement, on your hand can be made at a reasonable expense, either to yourself, if
you're self-owned, or to your owners, if such there are. In any case you'll be back at
your desk at Tri-Plan functioning just as before."
